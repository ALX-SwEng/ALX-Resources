* [x]    Yes, 3 bytes of memory were lost
* []    No, no memory leaks were possible
* []    Yes, 24 bytes of memory were lost
* []    Yes, 15 bytes of memory were lost
* []    I don't know  

#### 3\. The memory space reserved when calling `malloc` is on:

* [x]    The heap
* []    The stack
* []    I don't know  

#### 4\. What command(s) can be used to list the symbols stored in a static library?

Select all valid answers

* [x]    `nm`
* []    `ranlib`
* [x]    `ar`
* []    `ld`
* []    I don't know  

#### 5\. How many bytes will this statement allocate on a 64-bit machine?
```
`malloc(sizeof(int) * 4)`
```

* []    4
* []    8
* [x]    16
* []    32
* []    I don't know  

#### 6\. What is the size of `*p` in this code on a 64-bit machine?
```
    int **p;
```    

* []    4 bytes
* [x]    8 bytes
* []    16 bytes
* []    I don't know  

#### 7\. This `void (*anjula[])(int, float)` is:

* []    A pointer to a function that takes an `int` and a `float` as parameters and returns nothing
* []    A pointer to a function that takes an array of `int` and `float` as a parameter and returns nothing
* []    A pointer to a function that takes an `int` and a `float` as parameters and returns an empty array
* [x]    An array of pointers to functions that take an `int` and a `float` as parameters and returns nothing
* []    A pointer to an array of functions that take an `int` and a `float` as parameters and returns nothing
* []    I don't know  

#### 8\. What is wrong with the following code?

```
    int n = 5;
    int array[5];
    int i = 3;
    
    array[n] = i;
 ```   

* []    Nothing is wrong
* []    It is impossible to declare the variable `array` this way
* []    The array `array` is not entirely initialized
* [x]    While it is possible to access `array[n]`, we are not supposed to as this is not the array anymore
* []    I don't know  

#### 9\. What does this code print?

```
    void print(int nb)
    {
        printf("%d", nb);
        -- nb;
        if (nb > 0) 
        {
            print(nb);
        }
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
        print(4);
        return (0);

#### 10\. How much space would you need to allocate for a list node with the following structure on a 64-bit machine?

```
    /**
     * struct list_s - singly linked list
     * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
     * @len: length of the string
     * @next: points to the next node
     *
     * Description: singly linked list node structure
     * for your project
     */
    typedef struct list_s

        unsigned int len;
        struct list_s *next;
    } list_t;
```    

* [x]    20 bytes
* []    It's impossible to know without knowing what `str` is
* []    24 bytes
* []    32 bytes
* []    I don't know  

#### 11\. How many bytes will this statement allocate on a 64-bit machine?

```
`malloc(sizeof(char) * 10)`
```
* [x]    10
* []    20
* []    40
* []    80
* []    I don't know  

#### 12\. Given this code:

    struct point {
       int x;
       int y;
    };
    struct point my_point = { 3, 7 };
    struct point *p = &my_point;
```    

To set the member `y` of my variable `my_point` to `98`, I can do (select all valid answers):

* [x]    `my_point.y = 98;`
* []    `my_point->y = 98;`
* []    `p.y = 98;`
* [x]    `(*p).y = 98;`
* [x]    `p->y = 98;`
* []    I don't know  

#### 13\. What does the macro `TABLESIZE` expand to?

```
    #define BUFSIZE 1020
    #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
    #undef BUFSIZE
    #define BUFSIZE 37
```    

* []    1020
* [x]    37
* []    nothing
