This code doesn’t work as intended.

Let’s add `printf` statements to the code.
```
    #include "school.h"
    
    /**
    * main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
    * Return: 0
    */
    
    int main(void)
    {
            int i;
    
            printf("Before loop\n");
    
            for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
            {
                    if (i % 2 != 0)
                    {
                            printf("i is not even so don't print\n");
                            continue;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                            printf("i is even, break to print\n");
                            break;
                    }
    
                    printf("Outside of if/else, still inside for loop\n");
    
                    printf("%d\n", i);

            printf("For loop exited\n");
    
            return(0);

 ```   
What information do the `printf` statements tell us about how our code is executed? (select all valid statements)

* []    A `printf` statement shows when the for loop is finished
* [x]    A `printf` statement shows exactly how many times the loop executes
